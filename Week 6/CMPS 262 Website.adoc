## Version Differences
-V0.1 - Really basic template with just a image and text.  No CSS or JS/JQuery.

-V0.15 - Added some CSS and a navagation bar which goes to different sitesthat contains a table and another that is under construction.  Still very basic.

-V0.3 - Added an animation page with a bird gif that flies to the right as well as a Styles page that can test some styles on text.  Made the navigation bar also a little bit more nicer.  Removed YouTube page.

-V0.4 - Added a portfolio page that showcases some projects I made in the past.  Updated some CSS and made the navigaiton bar much nicer.

-V0.6 - Added a API page that contains 3 subpages: API info, NYTimes, and YouTube.  These pages show case how API's can be used as well as some information about them.  This was also the addition of the previously deleted YouTube page and is now functional.  It is not very pretty yet, but will be soon.

-V0.8 - Fixed the jquery/JS code so it is much more condensed and easier to read and follow for the main scirpt.  Edited the YouTube page so it is also not as basic.
